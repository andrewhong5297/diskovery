With Diskover, communities can stake on problems, then creators can publish content tied to that problem. Users get 1000 disk tokens a week to stake said content. Problems run for a ~month, at the end of which the total problem stake from communities at the start is split between the top 3-10 staked content creators on that problem. This way everyone is happy, communities get more coverage of their problem, writers can more easily find content/rewards to tackle, and users can take a problem-based approach to discovery of content/community.

This is a completely different way of managing and discovering content than the publication style business models of today. Publications will always grow out of their niche, communities will always be focused on their specific problems/products.
